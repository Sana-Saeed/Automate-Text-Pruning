# Automate-Text-Pruning
  The escalating volume of user-generated web content underscores the need for advancements in automated text processing. The efficacy of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques is profoundly influenced by the quality of data and precise labeling. Modern techniques for natural language analysis are voracious for data and demand meticulous annotation efforts. Real-world user-generated web content often carries excessive repetition. Such redundancy and data bloat has the potential to impede the performance of automated algorithms. Therefore, training datasets must mirror real-world complexity for optimal generalization, maintaining a balance between diversity and relevance, with minimal redundancy. Manual data annotation, though crucial, is a laborious and time-intensive task, particularly when addressing a multitude of concerns manually. Automated data pruning facilitates the selection of diverse data and enriches meaningful vocabulary by reducing the redundancy and eliminating the unnecessary and irrelevant information. In this study we propose text selection techniques based on the text similarity for automated unique review selection from a large dataset to aid the annotation process.
